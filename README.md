Hotel Side Hospital \n
Hotel-Side Hospital, a globally renowned hospital chain headquartered in Australia, is aiming to
streamline its operation by setting up an infrastructure within the hotel premises. However, in
order to maintain seamless functioning and scalability, they require fully managed virtual
machines (VMs) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.
The organization seeks an automated provisioned infrastructure solution that can enable them
to effortlessly create new Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters, whenever
required, and promptly delete them when they are no longer needed. This will optimize
resource allocation and enhance operational efficiency
