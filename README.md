   ## Hotel-Side Hospital:
      A globally-renowned hospital chain headquartered in Australia is aiming to
      streamline its operation by setting up an infrastructure within the hotel premises. However, in
      order to maintain seamless functioning and scalability, they require fully managed **virtual
      machines (VMs)** on the **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** platform.
      The organization seeks an automated provisioned infrastructure solution that can enable them
      to effortlessly create new **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** clusters, whenever
      required, and promptly delete them when they are no longer needed. This will optimize
      resource allocation and enhance operational efficiency
